# helicone
This is an OpenSCAD project to create a parametric helicone.

also on thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3440663

To create an helicone:
- find an axis
- find a base and drill a hole, make sure the axis can turn freely
- if you want to customize it: 
    - launch openscad and (re)generate helicone.dxf
    - open the dxf in a dxf editor and put the numbers back on the wings, they must be engraved (not cut !)
- lasercut the helicone
- glue the spacers one above / one below using the centering holes and paperclips
- the bottom spacer must be tied to the axis :)
- at the top of your axis, put something to hold everything together !
 
 What I did is that I drilled holes throughout the axis at the top and the bottom and then put some paperclip to hold everything together ;)

 that's it, have fun !

Improvements :
- rework the openscad file to clean it
- put an option to see position 2
- put an option to make an animation
- better optimize the space on the lasercut
